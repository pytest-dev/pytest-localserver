    # Future major versions of pytest may break backwards compatibility in a way
    # that prevents them from working with this package, so we prevent testing
    # with major versions that haven't been released yet. Each time a new major
    # version of pytest is released, once it's confirmed to work with this
    # package, we should bump this limit to the next major version.
    #
    # The lower bounds come from testing with different pytest versions using
    # tox's --force-dep option to find the earliest versions of pytest that are
    # known to work. If you add code that breaks with an old version of pytest,
    # feel free to raise these bounds to represent the earliest version that
    # works with your code. Don't forget to modify the corresponding entries in
    # the Github workflows configuration file if you do change these lower
    # bounds.
