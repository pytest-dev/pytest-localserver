pytest-localserver
==================

Sometimes `monkeypatching`_ ``urllib2.urlopen()`` just does not cut it, for
instance if you work with ``urllib2.Request``, define your own openers/handlers
or work with ``httplib``. In these cases it may come in handy to have an HTTP
server running locally which behaves just like the real thing [1]_. Well, look
no further!

pytest-localserver is a plugin for the `pytest`_ testing framework. It enables
you to write tests like the following::

    def test_retrieve_some_content(httpserver):
        httpserver.serve_content(open('cached-content.xml').read())
        assert my_content_retrieval(httpserver.url) == 'Found it!'

    def test_content_retrieval_fails_graciously(httpserver):
        httpserver.serve_content('File not found!', 404)
        pytest.raises(MyCustomException, my_content_retrieval, httpserver.url)

Additionally, it is also possible to simulate SMTP servers::

    def test_sending_some_message(smtpserver):
        mailer = MyMailer(host=smtpserver.addr[0], port=smtpserver.addr[1])
        mailer.send(to='bob@example.com', from_='alice@example.com',
            subject='MyMailer v1.0', body='Check out my mailer!')
        assert len(smtpserver.outbox)==1

It is really that easy!

Available funcargs
==================

``httpserver``
    provides a threaded HTTP server instance running on localhost. It has the
    following attributes:

    * ``code`` - HTTP response code (int)
    * ``content`` - content of next response (str)
    * ``headers`` - response headers (dict)

    Once these attribute are set, all subsequent requests will be answered with
    these values until they are changed or the server is stopped. A more 
    convenient way to change these is ::

        httpserver.server_content(content=None, code=200, headers=None) 

    The server address can be found in property

    * ``url``

    which is the string representation of tuple ``server_address`` (host as str,
    port as int).

``httpsserver``
    is the same as ``httpserver`` only with SSL encryption.

``smtpserver``
    provides a threaded instance of ``smtpd.SMTPServer`` runnning on localhost.
    It has the following attributes:

    * ``addr`` - server address as tuple (host as str, port as int)
    * ``outbox`` - a ``mailbox.Maildir`` instance containing all sent messages.
      It will live a temporary directory created with `tmpdir`_.

Download and Installation
=========================

You can install the plugin by running ::

    pip install pytest-localserver

Alternatively, get the latest stable version from `PyPI`_ or the latest
`bleeding-edge archive`_ from bitbucket.org.

Some parts of this package is based on ideas or code from other people:

- I borrowed some implementation ideas for the httpserver from `linkchecker`_.
- The implementation for the SMTP server is based on the `Mailsink recipe`_ by 
  Adam Feuer, Matt Branthwaite and Troy Frever.
- The HTTPS implementation is based on work by `Sebastien Martini`_.

Thanks guys!

Development and future plans
============================

Feel free to clone the repository and add your own changes. Pull requests are
always welcome!::

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/basti/pytest-localserver

If you find any bugs, please file a `report`_.

I already have a couple of ideas for future versions:

* support for FTP, SSH (maybe base all on twisted?)
* making the SMTP outbox as convenient to use as ``django.core.mail.outbox``
* add your own here!

.. [1] The idea for this project was born when I needed to check that `a piece
       of software`_ behaved itself when receiving HTTP error codes 404 and 500.
       Having unsuccessfully tried to mock a server, I stumbled across 
       `linkchecker`_ which uses a the same idea to test its internals.
